## Introduction
The Self-Balancing Robot is a project aimed at creating a robot that can balance itself on two wheels. The robot uses sensors and a control algorithm to maintain its balance.

## Features
- Self-balancing on two wheels
- Remote control via Bluetooth
- Real-time sensor data visualization
- Adjustable control parameters

## Hardware Requirements
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- IMU sensor (e.g., MPU6050)
- Motor driver (e.g., L298N)
- DC motors with wheels
- Power supply (e.g., battery pack)
- Bluetooth module (optional)
- Chassis and mounting hardware

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE or relevant microcontroller development environment
- Python (for data visualization and remote control, if applicable)
- Libraries:
  - `Wire.h` (for I2C communication)
  - `Adafruit_MPU6050.h` (for MPU6050 sensor)
  - `AFMotor.h` (for motor control)

## Installation
### Hardware Setup
1. Assemble the chassis and mount the motors.
2. Connect the IMU sensor to the microcontroller using I2C.
3. Connect the motor driver to the microcontroller and motors.
4. Connect the power supply.

### Software Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/self-balancing-robot.git
   ```
2. Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install the necessary libraries via the Library Manager.
4. Upload the code to the microcontroller.

## Usage
1. Power on the robot.
2. Place the robot in an upright position.
3. If using Bluetooth, connect your remote control device to the robot.
4. The robot should start balancing itself automatically.

## Calibration
1. Ensure the robot is on a flat surface.
2. Use the calibration mode in the code to adjust sensor offsets.
3. Fine-tune the PID control parameters for optimal performance.

## Troubleshooting
- **Robot not balancing:** Check connections, ensure sensors are working, and verify control parameters.
- **Motors not responding:** Verify motor driver connections and power supply.
- **Unstable balancing:** Adjust PID control parameters.

## Contributing
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
